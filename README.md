Teaching myself how to use Flask by making a wep app to browse th FDA's database of drugs.

From the home page, users can search through the database by name or category.
The name search is case-insensitive and works across both proprietary and generic drug names.
The category search is customizable and currently set up for the following two categories:
Cardiovascular : drugs listed in the pharmaceutical classes Antiarrhythmic(Cordarone, Lopressor, ...) and HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor (Atorvastatin, ...).
Antidepressant: drugs listed in the pharmaceutical classes Serotonin Uptake Inhibitor (Prozac, Zoloft,...) and Norepinephrine Uptake Inhibitor (Strattera, Wellbutrin, ...).

The raw data can be viewed and edited using Flask Admin at the following url:
